# turtlebot3_objdetection

## Evaluation of methods for object detection on the Turtlebot3 platform

This project will consider different approaches for object detection on the Turtlebot3 platform.Identifying objects with the specific platform widens the scope of operations the system can fulfilland enables it to react and interact with its environment.  Due to its modular design it can beequipped with a camera.  Therefore, objects should be identified by visual analysis.  Methodsfor detecting objects based on visual data should be implemented in the most general way andfor evaluation the following should be considered:  a local Neural Network, another running onspecialized hardware, outsourcing computation to the cloud and a classical machine learningapproach. These will be compared based on their performance and detection results.
